## Introduction

In this project, I have built and deployed a real time chat application for practising skills that are React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io. I made this application by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc)

Setup:

- run `npm i && npm start`
